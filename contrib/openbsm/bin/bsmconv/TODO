# Tests

- [ ] Test if the library properly converts pid fields and uid fields for edge
cases.

# Style & refactoring

- [x] Refactor the while loop in process_events() in bsmconv.c.
- [ ] Standardize the naming convention of static functions.

# Conversion

- [ ] Improve the conversion of the LOGIN type record. See an example
in tests/fields.centos.v265/LOGIN.input.
- [ ] Improve the cwd field value validation. At the moment it checks if
the value is _encoded_. Should it check if the path is actually a valid path?
