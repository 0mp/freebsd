Conversion
==========

Validation
----------

- [ ] Improve the cwd field value validation. At the moment it checks if
      the value is _encoded_.  Should it check if the path is actually a valid
      path?
- [ ] Regex fields validators should return only valid fields.

Improvements
------------

- [x] Add the Linux Audit record id to a sequence token.
- [ ] Improve the conversion of the LOGIN type record. See an example
      in tests/fields.centos.v265/LOGIN.input.
- [ ] Find out what does the _user_ thing mean in a Linux Audit record.  Does it
      indicate that the user is the subject of the _action_?
- [ ] Some fields like `ses` use the value of `-1` and some others like `auid`
      use `?`. What's the rule?
- [ ] Add the identifiers for Linux Audit events so that praudit can generate
      meaningful output because of the Linux dedicated identifiers
      in `/etc/security/audit_event`.

FreeBSD Improvements
====================

- [ ] Update the `au_token(3)` man page since it is super outdated.
    - `au_to_attr` has invalid arguements.
    - `man au_to_attr` doesn't open `au_token(3)`.
- [ ] Why isn't the pointer parameters of the au_to_* functions const? See
      `sys/security/audit/bsm_token.c:au_to_exec_args` for example.  For example
      `au_to_exec_args` does not modify the parameters; as the function uses
      `memcpy(3)` it does not _consume_ the parameters.

Maintainability
===============

- [ ] Add a script which validates that every lcrt_tokens list has
      a termianting NULL.

Style & Refactoring
===================

- [x] Refactor the while loop in process_events() in bsmconv.c.
- [ ] Standardize the naming convention of static functions.
    - May all the interface functions be prefixed with `linau_`.
- [ ] Allign the protypes of static functions (as in style(9)).
- [ ] Should I use protected names (see style(9))?
- [ ] Find out if you should treat int* as an integer or as a pointer as you
      sort the variable declarations in functions (see style(9)).
- [ ] Unify the lctokens for the _res_ and _result_ fields.
- [ ] Use pjdlog.h instead of `printf` in `linau_event_dump` (pjdlog.h is said
      to cause problems when used together with `printf`).

Tests
=====

- [ ] Test if the library properly converts pid fields and uid fields for edge
      cases.
- [ ] `argc="text"`
