# Conversion

- [ ] Improve the conversion of the LOGIN type record. See an example
in tests/fields.centos.v265/LOGIN.input.
- [ ] Improve the cwd field value validation. At the moment it checks if
the value is _encoded_. Should it check if the path is actually a valid path?

# FreeBSD improvements.

- [ ] Update the `au_token(3)` man page since it is super outdated.
 - `au_to_attr` has invalid arguements.
 - `man au_to_attr` doesn't open `au_token(3)`.
- [ ] Why isn't the pointer parameters of the au_to_* functions const? See
`sys/security/audit/bsm_token.c:au_to_exec_args` for example.
 For example `au_to_exec_args` does not modify the parameters; as the function
 uses `memcpy(3)` it does not _consume_ the parameters.

# Style & refactoring

- [x] Refactor the while loop in process_events() in bsmconv.c.
- [ ] Standardize the naming convention of static functions.
- [ ] Allign the protypes of static functions (as in style(9)).
- [ ] Should I use protected names (see style(9))?
- [ ] Find out if you should treat int* as an integer or as a pointer as you
sort the variable declarations in functions (see style(9)).

# Tests

- [ ] Test if the library properly converts pid fields and uid fields for edge
cases.
